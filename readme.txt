== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The bubble doesn't show up nicely in my sidebar, what is wrong? =

It is likely that your sidebar is simply too narrow. The bubble requires a width of at least 230 pixels,
and works best with at around 400 pixels or more.

= It keeps showing the text "Loading..."? =

Make sure your theme uses the hooks `wp_head()` and `wp_footer`, otherwise the necessary CSS and JavaScript won't be sent to your browser.

= Who came up with the bubble design? =

A very similar looking design was first spotted at the [homepage of Danish politician Ida Auken](http://www.idaauken.dk/).

= Can I put it somewhere else besides the sidebar? =

Yes. Simply add the template tag `<?php twitter_bubble('<yourtwitterusername', 'optional prefix: '); ?>` somewhere
in your theme. 
If your theme doesn't support the hooks `wp_head()` and `wp_footer`, you will also need to place calls to`
`twitter_bubble_head()` and `twitter_bubble_footer()` in the header and footer, respectively.

= I have translated the plugin into another language, now what? =

Great, thanks! Please do leave a comment on the plugin's homepage
[www.mfd-consult.dk/twitter-bubble](http://www.mfd-consult.dk/twitter-bubble/) or send an e-mail with details; I'll
make sure it's included in the next version.

= What's in the pipeline? =

A real roadmap isn't in place, but the following features are currently on the to-do list:
* Translation of (copy of) JavaScript from Twitter.
* Multiuser support.
